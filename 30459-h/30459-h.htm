<p>Should be kept constantly at hand, for use in emergencies of the
household. Many a mother, startled in the night by the ominous sounds
of Croup, finds the little sufferer, with red and swollen face,
gasping for air. In such cases Ayer's Cherry Pectoral is invaluable.
Mrs. Emma Gedney, 159 West 128 st., New York, writes: "While in the
country, last winter, my little boy, three years old, was taken ill
with Croup; it seemed as if he would die from strangulation. Ayer's
Cherry Pectoral was tried in small and frequent doses, and, in less
than half an hour, the little patient was breathing easily. The
doctor said that the Pectoral saved my darling's life." Mrs. Chas. B.
Landon, Guilford, Conn., writes: "Ayer's Cherry Pectoral</p>

<span class="large"><b>Saved My Life,</b></span><br />

<p>and also the life of my little son. As he is troubled with Croup, I
dare not be without this remedy in the house." Mrs. J. Gregg, Lowell,
Mass., writes: "My children have repeatedly taken Ayer's Cherry
Pectoral for Coughs and Croup. It gives immediate relief, followed by
cure." Mrs. Mary E. Evans, Scranton, Pa., writes: "I have two little
boys, both of whom have been, from infancy, subject to violent
attacks of Croup. About six months ago we began using Ayer's Cherry
Pectoral, and it acts like a charm. In a few minutes after the child
takes it, he breathes easily and rests well. Every mother ought to
know what a blessing I have found in Ayer's Cherry Pectoral." Mrs.
Wm. C. Reid, Freehold, N. J., writes: "In our family, Ayer's
medicines have been blessings for many years. In cases of Colds and
Coughs, we take</p>

friend advised me to take this medicine. It gave prompt relief, and

which we could not cure. We tried many remedies, but he continued to
grow worse, and finally became so reduced in flesh that we could only

Scrofula might be the cause of the trouble. We procured a bottle of</p>

<p>Where the color-sergeant plants the standard, there the soldiers are
expected to rally. The Finance Committee at the Salem meeting
inscribed on the A. M. A. standard $365,000 needed for 1884-5, and
called upon the churches to advance to the support. <i>The Figures</i>
showing receipts of our treasury indicate just how far the churches
have come up in response to the call. Had we received the $1,000 a
day recommended, our total receipts would be $123,000, as against the
$75,684.88 now reported. Will not the captains of our church hosts
rally the forces to an immediate advance? One-third of our fiscal
year has already passed. The showing is not what we had hoped, but
time enough remains to make up for the deficiency.</p>

<h3>DEATH OF REV. G. D. PIKE, D. D.</h3>


<p>In the death of Dr. Pike, which occurred in Hartford, Conn., Jan. 29,
the American Missionary Association has lost a most earnest and
successful worker. Repeated and protracted attacks of throat and lung
troubles during the last two or three years, terminating in an
illness that confined him to his room for three months, gave warning
to his friends of the approach of death. But with the hopefulness
peculiar to the disease, and especially characteristic of himself, he
entertained almost to the last the expectation of recovery. Yet death
had no terror; on the contrary, while he wished to live for the sake
of his family and the Association, he personally welcomed death with
the most joyful feelings.</p>

<p>Dr. Pike was born in Topsfield, Mass., Aug. 6, 1831, graduated from
Dartmouth College in 1858, and from Andover Theological Seminary in
1861. He was ordained associate pastor with Rev. Austin Richards, D.
D., of the Olive Street Congregational Church, Nashua, N. H., April
23, 1862, and remained in that position till May 1, 1865. He was
acting pastor at East Hampton, Conn., from 1865 to 1867, and during
the latter year he entered the service of the Association as agent,
residing in Rochester, N. Y. In 1870 he became District Secretary, a
position which he filled till his death, and to which he devoted the
best energies of his life. His peculiar gifts fitted him for some
special services. During the years 1872-4 he accompanied the Jubilee
Singers in a tour through the United States and Great Britain. They
were welcomed by the royal family and by the nobility, and by large
and enthusiastic popular audiences. Their success, in its pecuniary
results, finds a fitting monument in the substantial and commodious
Jubilee Hall, at Nashville, Tenn.; and the untiring industry, the
skill and tact and energy of Mr. Pike as business manager contributed
in a large measure to this gratifying result. Before returning to
America he made a rapid trip through Egypt and Palestine. In 1881 he
assumed the editorship of the <i>American Missionary</i>, and brought to
that service a degree of variety and breadth that gave a new impulse
to the usefulness of the magazine. He devoted much thought and
research to the condition of Africa, and became so well acquainted
with it that editors of leading journals in this city and pastors of
churches sometimes sought information from him in regard to it. He
wrote two volumes on the History of the Jubilee Singers, which have
had a very wide circulation.</p>

<p>Dr. Pike was eminently social and was blessed with unusual
conversational powers, and gave to others and won from them to
himself strong personal friendships. As a public speaker he was
earnest, animated and eloquent, and was gladly welcomed in the pulpit
and in the meetings of Associations and Conferences. His leading
characteristic was that of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> organizer. He was perpetually devising
plans for active work and was diligent and untiring in his efforts to
carry them out. He was a man of prayer and of faith in God, which
sustained him in his constant labors, in his days of trial and in his
sickness and death. At his own request his mortal remains rest in
Nashua, the scene of his first pastorate, and his long sleep will be
with those whom he loved. By the generosity of Mrs. O. A. Woodbury a
portion of a cemetery lot was given for his burial, on which an
expensive monument is erected, and on one face of which will be
inscribed his name.</p>

<p>Since writing the above we have learned that a special memorial
service was held Sunday evening, February 1st, in the Chapel of Fisk
University. This was in every way appropriate, in consequence of the
intimate relations of Dr. Pike's life to the upbuilding of that
institution. With considerable feeling, President Cravath referred to
the fact that twenty years ago E. P. Smith, Dr. Pike and himself
entered upon the work of the American Missionary Association, and
that he was now left alone, adding that in the death of Brother Pike,
Fisk University had lost one of its warmest friends.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<p>We notice the death of Mrs. Dr. L. B. Lane, of St. Charles, Ill. She
died on the 14th of January last, at the age of sixty-two years. Mrs.
Lane and her husband were ordained missionaries of the Am. Miss.
Assoc. to Siam in 1848. They returned in 1855, since which time they
have resided in this country. She was a good and true servant of
Christ when in the foreign field and no less so in her own land. Her
death came suddenly, but found her thoroughly prepared to go.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>Few men in this country have had more experience in addressing
children, or greater success in winning them to Christ, than Rev. E.
P. Hammond. The result of this experience he has condensed in an
interesting and instructive little volume, entitled "Conversion of
Children." It will prove helpful and encouraging to parents and
interesting to children. We thank Mr. Hammond for the gift of fifty
copies of his book, which we have distributed among our missionaries
in the South, by whom they are appreciated and found useful in their
work.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>Some time ago a Southern paper, in speaking of Dr. Roy, referred to
him as a colored man. At the time we thought the writer was mistaken,
but since looking over his itinerary, which our readers will find in
another part of the magazine, we have been led to feel that we shall
have to modify somewhat our opinion. The doctor himself explicitly
declares that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> at one point in their journey he and his companions
were all of the same color. At any rate he is not ashamed to call
them <i>brethren</i>, and we may also add that they are not ashamed of
him.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<p>The Tillotson, at Austin, Texas, has taken to itself a church
organization. This was effected on the first Sabbath of the year&mdash;a
very interesting occasion. Superintendent Roy and Rev. Jeremiah
Porter, spending his second winter in Austin, were present to assist
the pastor, Rev. J. H. Parr, who, with his wife, united in the
organization. It consisted of twenty members, half of them teachers
and half students. Principal W. L. Gordon and wife presented their
two little children, born in the Institute, for baptism. Mr. Gordon
and Mr. R. F. Ferrell, a student, were ordained as deacons by prayer
and the laying on of hands. Mr. Porter offered the prayer of
institution, and broke the bread at the communion table. This
venerable servant of God had just passed his 80th birthday. His
golden wedding will come next June. His multitude of friends will be
glad to know that the United States Government, having put him upon
the retired list as chaplain, is continuing his salary. Mrs. Porter
is assisting the special missionary, Miss M. J. Adams, Professor
Dean, and other teachers and scholars, in supporting two mission
schools contiguous to the Institute. Miss Rose M. Kinney, a veteran
in the service, is matron and preceptress. The Tillotson is moving on
this year smoothly and successfully. A church in connection with
these main chartered institutions is essential to their best
Christian result.</p>

<p>Just a word with our ministerial readers. The heavy mail that daily
comes to this office brings us occasionally a letter with some such
words as these: "I preached to my people last Sunday an A. M. A.
sermon, and as a result I send you a contribution which is larger
than the church ever gave this cause before." Exactly, brother; let
the people know what is wanted and why it is wanted, and then let
them have a chance to give and they will meet the responsibility
every time. Another letter brings us this: "A few weeks ago I
preached a sermon on the work of the A. M. A. My congregation were so
deeply interested in what I said they requested my manuscript for
publication. Thinking you might be interested I send you a copy of
the published sermon." Exactly, again. We were interested, and long
before we had finished reading the discourse we understood full well
why the people were interested. Another letter: "The Missions of the
A. M. A. occupied our attention last monthly concert. I gave a bird's
eye view of the whole field and then selections were read from the
papers and addresses given at Salem. By this time the brethren were
quite ready to turn on the streams of their own thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> We found it
difficult to bring the meeting to an end. It was a great success. I
propose to follow it up." Again, exactly. Missionary information when
properly brought forward will make a meeting that for interest cannot
be surpassed. It is one of the strangest things in the world that so
many people have gotten the impression that a missionary meeting must
be dull, and that a missionary discourse must be uninteresting. It is
an impression that ought not to exist. Let sermons be preached. Let
the thrilling, soul-inspiring facts that go to make up the history of
missions be made known and the impression will soon be driven out of
existence.</p>

<p>Brethren, we invite you to glean in the great field of the American
Missionary Association. There will be rich returns for you and your
people and golden returns for us.</p>

<h3>THE TEST APPLIED.</h3>


<p>When Berea College was started, in 1858, its students were all
white. The following year the question was raised, "What if colored
students should apply?" One teacher voiced the sentiment of all when
he said, "If any one made in God's image comes to get knowledge which
will enable him to understand the revelation of God in Jesus Christ,
he cannot be rejected." The simple declaration of that sentiment had
the effect to make most of the students leave at the end of the term,
never to return. The John Brown raid, happening soon after, rendered
the school still more unpopular, and the war following a little
later, the school had to suspend altogether. But when the war ended
and, in 1865, the college opened its doors again, there being no
longer slavery, the question of color soon came up for consideration.</p>

<p>In one of the by-laws to the constitution of the college was this
statement: "The object of this college shall be to furnish the
facilities for a thorough education to all persons of good moral
character." Three colored youths applied for admission. On
examination they were found to be "persons of good moral character."
There was only one thing to do. They were promptly admitted. What
followed? There were at the time seventy-five students in the
college, and we are told, "the morning that those three harmless
youths walked in, half the school walked out."</p>

<p>But some one will say: "That was at the close of the war, when the
feelings of our white brethren at the South were naturally very
sensitive; that time, however, has passed away. We can now plant
schools and churches on an anti-caste basis, with open doors and
welcome hands for colored people, <i>if they choose to come</i>. No such
exhibition of race prejudice would now be made." <i>Well, let us see.</i></p>

<p>For several years past we have had our attention turned to the
terrible destitution of the people in the mountain region of Kentucky
and places adjacent. Two years ago we sent a special missionary to
labor among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> these people. He made his headquarters at Williamsburg,
the county seat of Whitley County, Kentucky. The town was sixty-seven
years old, yet it never had a church edifice; nor had the county,
with a population of fourteen thousand, ever had a church edifice
finished and dedicated to the worship of Almighty God. There were
very few schools, and what few there were could not be considered
schools by intelligent people. Our missionary went to work. The
people heard him gladly. A new life came into their famished souls.
They rallied round him. They built a beautiful church edifice. An
academy, too, was erected; able and skilled teachers were put in
charge. The missionary did not confine himself to the town merely.
For miles up and down the valley he traveled, preaching as he went.
Wherever he came the people were roused and steps taken to have
churches and schools planted.</p>

<p>But the church and the academy above referred to must be dedicated.
At the dedication this Association was represented by Assistant
Corresponding Secretary Powell, by Field Superintendent Roy and by
Rev. Dr. Wm. H. Ward, of the Executive Committee. And dedicated they
were to the glory of God for the maintenance and spread of a <i>free</i>
gospel and Christian learning. Special emphasis was placed upon the
fact that over the entrance to these temples was written, <i>Whosoever
will may come</i>. Does some one ask why that was specially emphasized?
Because we were in a country where popular sentiment said, Into white
churches and white schools there was a certain class who, on account
of the color of their skin, would not be admitted. When you are in a
community that publicly indorses a wrong, silence regarding that
wrong is complicity. Under such circumstances, to say nothing about
it is the same thing as to sign your name to a document affirming the
thing to be right. To dedicate a Christian church in New York City
and say nothing about the evils of Mormonism would be nothing
strange, but to dedicate a Christian church in Salt Lake City and be
silent as to what the teaching and the practice of that church was to
be in regard to polygamy would be <i>treason</i> to the Gospel. We
therefore made specially prominent at the dedication the broad
principles on which our mission rested. Some said they were sorry to
hear such things proclaimed; others said nothing, but feared; while a
few said, That is right. It is just as it ought to be.</p>

<p>The school started off with bright skies above and a broad distant
view around. The bell rung out its pealing calls, and bright-eyed,
rosy-cheeked children and youth clambered up the hill side to enjoy
such educational privileges as that country had never known. All was
peace and prosperity. School was crowded, and everybody was happy.
But suddenly the whole heavens were overcast. From horizon to horizon
a deathly pall enshrouded the entire sky&mdash;and the cloud large enough
to do all this was only the size of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> a black child's face! <i>Whosoever
will may come</i>, we had said. Did we <i>mean</i> it? Oh, yes, <i>but</i> it is
hardly right to sacrifice the feelings of that whole school merely to
gratify the wish of&mdash;<i>a nigger</i>. Did we mean it? Oh, yes, but it is
hardly right to imperil the very existence of the school merely to
take in that one poor, despised and uninfluential colored child! Did
we mean it? Oh, yes, but is it right, is it wise, to receive <i>one</i>
when you know that by so doing you will lose twenty&mdash;perhaps more&mdash;to
receive one whom you will have to help, and lose twenty&mdash;or perhaps
more&mdash;who can help you? Did we mean it? Oh, yes, certainly, but would
it not be better to reason with the applicant and show her that while
we ourselves have no objection, yet things being as they are, she
would really do more for her people by staying away than by insisting
that she should be received? Why not take some such position as that?
We will have peace and harmony and prosperity. We shall be able to
tell our friends in the distance we are getting along swimmingly. We
are true to our principles. <i>Whosoever will may come.</i> We have no
trouble with the negro question. We simply let it alone. Our dear
brethren down South are perfectly delighted to receive us. We have no
trouble with them whatever, and the cause is going forward
triumphantly.</p>

<p><i>Is</i> that the way to meet the responsibility? Imagine the Lord Jesus
Christ at the door of that school when that black child came asking
admission. What would have been His answer? Say, reader, imagine what
<i>would</i> have been His answer. Put on your thinking cap. Summon to
your aid all the help that quibbling and dodging and sophistry can
give, and after you have gone through it all, what do you think would
have been His answer? Well, here is the answer the American
Missionary Association sent as quickly as the telegraph could carry
it: <i>Admit all applicants irrespective of color.</i> And then what
followed? Nearly half the scholars picked up their things and left!
This happened a few weeks ago. We had about a hundred students. We
have now about fifty, and we may lose even those. Letter writing is
easy. Talk is cheap. Even <i>Buncombe</i> is not a lost art. But actions
speak louder than words. Let us know what follows when <i>the test is
applied</i>, and then we shall know just what profession of loyalty to
principle signifies. Berea stood by its guns, and it has steadily
grown in favor with God and man ever since. And it will win in the
end. Then what a glorious triumph! No regrets for having played the
hypocrite, no regrets for having played the part of a time server, no
regrets for having played the part of a trimmer, no regrets for
having played the part of a special pleader, no regrets for having
concealed its colors behind its back in shameful silence as to its
past history, no regrets for having turned away one of Christ's
little ones for whom He died, no regrets for having counseled it,
while professing friendship, to go elsewhere. What a glorious
triumph!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>And we, too, shall win&mdash;and our triumph shall be glorious. Let us go
forward preaching the Word, and when the time comes let there be no
attempt to postpone its issue&mdash;but let the test be applied. Better go
down standing on our principles than live with our principles denied
and dishonored.</p>

<h3>RELIGIOUS CULTURE OF THE SLAVES BEFORE THE WAR.</h3>


<p>The <i>Independent</i> of Feb. 5 has an exceedingly interesting article on
the above subject from the pen of Rev. Dr. J. E. Edwards, Danville,
Virginia.</p>

<p>He says that at an early period in this century Southern Methodists
sent missionaries to labor with the slaves on the rice and cotton
plantations. In 1845 Southern Methodism had in church fellowship
124,000 slaves. At one time the Methodist membership in Charleston,
S. C., was in the proportion of five colored to one white. Blacks and
whites worshiped in the same house and were ministered to by the same
pastor.</p>

<p>One of the early reports of the South Carolina Board has the
following: "We claim it best, as a general rule, to include the
colored people in the same pastoral charge with the whites, and to
preach to both classes in one congregation, as our practice has been.
The gospel is the same for all men, and to enjoy its privileges in
common, promotes good will."</p>

<p>We read so far and stopped. That language has the marks of the gospel
of Jesus Christ all over it. "All ye are brethren." So says the
gospel, and this report says the same. But how would it do to take
the language above quoted into a Southern white Methodist Conference
now! Just let the above report, without comment and without
explanation, be introduced to-day into such a Conference, and what an
explosion would follow!</p>

<p>It is too bad to quote the rest of the report, because it mars
somewhat the beauty of what goes before; but here it is: "That when
the galleries or other sittings are insufficient, we consider it the
duty of our brethren and friends to provide the necessary
accommodations that none may make such a neglect a plea for absenting
themselves from public worship." "<i>Galleries or other sittings.</i>"
There is the fly in the ointment. Of course, at communion, the master
class was served first and the slave class afterward.</p>

<p>The Church of Christ is His body. But does Christ allow His followers
to decide that distinctions shall be made at His table on account of
the hue of the skin? When a Temple is erected in which Christ's
disciples are to meet for worship, is there anything in the gospel
that warrants a division of seats so that here superiors shall sit
and there inferiors? Where is the word that warrants it? and what is
the analysis that will find it in the spirit of the gospel? All honor
to the slave-holders who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> furnished the means of the gospel to the
slaves. All honor to the men and women who pointed the sin-burdened
negroes to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. We
have no doubt but that as Dr. Edwards says, "Multiplied thousands
upon thousands of the sons of Ham will rise up in judgment to bless
the faithful men of the South for their long-continued labors in
teaching the benighted negro the way of life." We have no doubt of
it; but in the resurrection will the whites put in an appearance
first and the blacks second? In the day of judgment will the whites
lead and the blacks follow? Will there be galleries with hard seats
in Heaven for negroes and ground floors easy of access with soft
seats for Caucasians? Will the great chorus of Heaven be divided into
two parts, a white division and a black division? And will the
Hallelujah Chorus as sung by the white choir be more acceptable to
God than that sung by the black choir?</p>

<p>Yes, the slave-holders did a great deal for the religious training
and the spiritual welfare of the slaves, and in consequence of what
they did, with God's blessing, the colored people of our country are
almost immeasurably lifted above their benighted heathen brethren in
Africa. Yes, that is all so. Does Dr. Edwards ask us to praise them
for it? We do. But, brethren, we must also add, "These ought ye to
have done and not to leave the other undone."</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h3>A TEACHER'S APPEAL.</h3>


<p>We publish the following from F. A. Chase, Professor of Natural
Science in Fisk University. He pleads, of course, for Fisk, yet his
plea holds good for all our higher institutions. We commend it to our
friends. The American Missionary Association could make good use,
say, of a "<i>One Hundred Thousand Dollar Fund</i>" for the scientific
departments of its mission schools. It may be that some one whom God
has blessed with riches is waiting for just such an opportunity as
this particular branch of our great field opens. Special funds for a
designated institution, to be used for the promotion of Christian
science, as outlined by Prof. Chase, are earnestly solicited:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Are there not some friends of the work among the Freedmen
who can appreciate the need of a teacher for a <i>complete
scientific outfit</i>?</p>

<p>The race has been kept during slavery from all knowledge
of science. Their trades and occupations being of the
roughest, and having ignorant parentage, nothing has been
learned from the business of life, nor in answer to the
questioning of childhood and youth. There is no race now
admitted to the privileges of liberal education so barren
of scientific ideas and so lacking in scientific spirit.
Those who know this people solely from their fine
literary and oratorical abilities have no conception of
their great deficiency in science. It does not need to be
said that, until this is remedied, they cannot be
expected to hold their own in a scientific age, and in
competition with a scientific race.</p>

<p>Though our course of study is brought down to the very
minimum of college<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> work, and the instruction is of a
most elementary character, still there are eight sciences
to be taught. But this teaching, to be successful,
requires the use of illustrative material. With the
general introduction of illustrations in our modern
schools began the rapid progress in science that
distinguishes our age. All true teachers of science
affirm with one voice that this aid is indispensable even
with the most favored races.</p>

<p>In botany, zoology, mineralogy and geology we need
specimens&mdash;the great type examples on which
classification is founded. In physiology and anatomy we
need, in default of <i>material</i>, cheap models. In natural
philosophy, chemistry and astronomy we need
apparatus&mdash;not the costly instruments of precision, but
plain, cheap pieces, that are fitted to illustrate and in
some cases demonstrate the many and various principles
that are taught.</p>

<p>In the pressure of the growing work upon the society,
beyond a small sum for incidental expenses, most of the
money appropriated for schools goes for the payment of
salaries. Our land and our buildings have come from other
sources. But our outfit of school requisites has been for
the most part overlooked. Some fine instruments have been
presented to us, much more costly than we would have
selected for ourselves; but their value would be
increased many fold by accessory and supplementary
apparatus. Are there not those who can, by special gifts,
make up this lack also? Must <i>we</i>, of all other teachers
of science, be left to make bricks without straw? What
answer should be made to those who depreciate the negro's
mental capacity? Is it not a pitiful waste of the
opportunity, that a factory building should be put up,
workmen hired, materials supplied, but no <i>machinery</i> put
in? Yet this has been going on with class after class for
ten years.</p>

<p>Three-fourths of our graduates follow teaching as a
profession, and are more or less teachers of science.
They should not only learn that which apparatus alone can
teach, but also how to use it themselves. Should a master
workman be expected to teach the theory and practice of a
trade through the use of <i>pictures</i> of tools and
machines?</p>

<p>We have not neglected our opportunities in respect to
making collections of specimens about us, and
constructing cheap forms of apparatus. We have learned
new trades and toiled early and late and often through
whole vacations. But, without workshop appliances, part
of that accomplished is unsatisfactory, and the major and
more difficult part remains untouched. But where one has
a great pressure of outside duties incidental to such a
work as this, how utterly inadequate such driblets of
time as can be spared are for such a task can easily be
imagined.</p>

<p>Is there any lover of science and friend of the freedmen
who can understand our condition and give us ten thousand
dollars for an outfit, and if possible an additional sum
as an endowment for annual expenses?</p></div>

<h3>ADDRESS AT ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>

<hr class="section" />

<h3>PREACHING THE MAIN FACTOR IN MISSIONARY WORK.</h3>

<div class="center">REV. GEORGE R. LEAVITT.</div>


<p>It is a fact of history that the preaching of the Word has been the
great missionary agency. The Bible is a missionary book. The great
figure in the Old Testament history was the preacher of
righteousness&mdash;Enoch, Samuel, Elijah, Isaiah, the great line of
prophets&mdash;they were missionary preachers. In the beginning of
Christianity, the great figure was the preacher&mdash;John the Baptist,
the Apostles, our blessed Lord Himself. The salient feature in the
New Testament may be said to be a succession of great missionary
sermons which are expositions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> of the Gospel. In the history of the
Christian Church the great figure has been the preacher. The Church
of God is the body of Jesus Christ. As such she is the eye and ear,
she is the hands and feet of the Lord, but especially she is the
voice of the Lord. Doth not wisdom cry in all time? Did not the
Spirit when sent forth lift the voice declaring the great Gospel
message? And when the Church has had that possession of the Spirit,
has it not been especially her inspiration to cry out with the Gospel
message? The great figure in this Association work in the past has
been the teacher. We have had a gifted line of men and women in this
work, and to them all honor be given. It would be impossible for us
to give them the honor which is their due; but in the future the
great figure is to be the missionary preacher, the man who can reach
masses of men with the Gospel message. We are lifting this race, and
what has been true in the past will be true in the future.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can not better exhibit this subject in the little space
allowed me than in noticing some of the traits which should
characterize the missionary preacher, and while the truth is general
and applicable to all parties, I trust that we may be under the
direction of the Spirit and take to heart these great traits we shall
be looking for in the preacher of the future in the South.</p>

<p>The missionary preacher is a man who, to be effective, should be a
man of spiritual morality, a man of irreproachable character. I
presume the colored man has been maligned in the South, as his
character has so often been brought out among us. One of our
enthusiastic teachers was asked, "How many Uncle Toms do you find in
the South?" And she replied, "About as many as there are in the
North." A truth was there that we ourselves may very well take.</p>

<p>There are three ways in which the Gospel is published. One is in the
book, one is by the voice, and the third by the life. The voice lies
between the book and the life, and the life is the great publication
of the message, and unless we have a voice of a man who is
spiritually qualified by a holy life, we have not a competent Gospel
preacher. In speaking of this matter of morality, we should have
something more in view than natural morals&mdash;there is a spiritual
morality. We want the higher. A man who has in himself the Spirit of
God, produces this type of morality. We can not canvass this subject
by the motives of worldliness. It takes two crosses to save the
world&mdash;the cross of Christ and the cross of the believer. A
ministerial brother said, in speaking of certain ones, that they had
undergone a deplorable religious transformation, that at one time
they held the Gospel of regeneration, but they had come to love the
Gospel of recreation. Ah, what a transformation has come over too
many of our churches and the community in loving this form of
worldliness!</p>

<p>It is a matter of great satisfaction that our schools in the South
are doing such efficient work in this direction, as reports indicate,
and as private information shows. I quite lately had information from
General Armstrong touching this point of high morality that is
developed in the school. The young men and young women, he said,
compare well with the young men and young women in our Northern
schools. This is a matter of great satisfaction, because the preacher
of the future is to come out of these schools.</p>

<p>The second essential in the missionary preacher, if he is to be
successful, is a mind which is spiritually illuminated, a man who is
intelligent in the truth. I presume the great characteristic of the
old-time preacher in the South is his ignorance, and if we should
select one point at which a change needs to take place, it is at this
point of instruction. He needs to be intelligent.</p>

<p>Now, to these things ought to be added training in all branches of
knowledge, just as widely as possible, but we must fix our attention
especially upon one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> source of knowledge, namely, the Word of God.
The missionary preacher needs to be a man established in the
Scriptures. John the Baptist grew in grace. Our blessed Lord Himself
grew in grace. The man who is to be effective as a preacher in
elevating the world is a man who grows in grace. What is grace? It is
the undeserved favor of God exhibited in the plan of salvation for
the redemption of man. And the first truths of that grace say simply,
but how grandly, "grow in grace;" we are to be "ministers of grace;"
to be "masters of grace." The minister in the South is to be a master
of grace. Do you know how far it is away? It seems but a step, but
oh, what a work when we begin to comprehend the great things of God!
Do you know the height, depth and length of the great salvation of
the love of God? Ezekiel tells us of the depth of the stream when he
first came to it, that to his apprehension the water came up to his
foot, but, as he advanced, it came to the ankle, and the knee and the
loin, and then it was water to swim in, a river that could not be
passed over. Oh, my brethren, we need to understand these great
things of God, so that we may become masters of grace, for if we do
not, the missionary preacher that comes up under our influence will
not be thoroughly qualified for his duties.</p>

<p>Then there is another quality; the missionary preacher, to be
effective as a missionary, must be, not only a "shining," but like
John also a "burning light." Then nothing shall be concealed. What
does the Scripture say in that psalm? "There is nothing hid from the
light?" No; "There is nothing hid from the heat thereof." We want a
Gospel preacher among those people who has a Gospel heat from which
nothing can be hid. How many things we can say of this fuel! We have
spoken of the Word of God. The Word of God is the light, and it is
the fuel for a fire. Our blessed Saviour when He was on the way to
Emmaus with the Disciples enkindled their hearts, not by his personal
presence; but when he opened the Scriptures, then they testified,
"Did not our hearts burn within us?" That was what took place at
Pentecost. The Holy Spirit did not bring the fuel that day, but they
had been gathering it as they spoke of Christ, and as they came
together to offer prayers, the Holy Spirit came, and the Word was a
fire in their bones; then fire came and kindled them, and then came
that wonderful effect.</p>

<p>Sir James Herschel tells us in a little story, in fragments of his
biography, how after his telescopes became famous they were
distributed quite widely through Europe, and when he published his
great discovery, he began to receive complaints. Men said to him, in
angry letters, "We do not see what you see." In his response to them
he said: "Perhaps you do not take the care in your observations that
I do," and he spoke of one particular thing that is carefully noted.
"Do you take care," he said, "of the matter of temperature? The
instrument with which I examine the stars must be of the temperature
of the stars as nearly as may be, and when I observe on a winter
night I place my glass on the lawn at Greenwich, and let it stand
there until the instrument comes to be of the temperature of the air.
But beyond that," he said, "not only must my instrument be of the
right temperature, but I must be. Oftentimes," he said, "I have been
out in the winter air for two hours before I would open my glass,
because I must come to be of the same temperature as the instrument
itself." What a spiritual truth there is here! God's Word the
instrument, and the temperature that of the heavens. But we must be
of the temperature of that Bible and that heavens! Oh, for the heat
of the Gospel to be in the minister of Christ wherever he stands, and
then there will be nothing hid from its searching power.</p>

<p>I think this subject is often presented in a way to confuse it. We
speak of heat in a way not to comprehend precisely what we want; and
let me touch upon the point which shows what I mean. When the Saviour
was at the well with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> woman, it was the love in His heart from
which she could not be hid. What a lesson Peter learned that day when
our Saviour, in His great interview by the sea, asked him: "Lovest
thou me?" and said, "Feed my sheep and my lambs." There was a lesson
burned into his heart of the personal love of Christ.</p>

<p>I heard Mr. Sankey sing last week "The Ninety and Nine," and he
prefaced it by saying that the old hymn was worn out. I was sorry to
hear him say that, but there was one accent he gave in singing which
was very affecting. When one expostulates with the shepherd that he
has ninety and nine with him, he cries out: "It is my sheep." I fancy
when Peter came to Pentecost and saw those great crowds before him
there was one element of preparation he needed, and the Saviour had
taught him how to feed his sheep and feed his lambs, and it lived so
in his heart that nothing could be hid from it.</p>

<p>I am speaking too long on this matter. But it is a great subject.
This Association has a glorious opportunity. There is no cause that
comes to us that touches our inspiration and consecration like this
society, and the opportunity is such as, in my judgment, the
Christian Church never had.</p>

<p>Now, we say this, we cannot do this work by any other form of service
but by preaching the Gospel, with at least these elements in it I
have mentioned. We speak of the hand work for Christ, but we want the
net work for Christ. When I was in Japan, I saw all over the bay, in
the night, little boats of fishermen. The men were in the boats two
and two, one holding a torch. They were busily engaged the night
through. I asked one, "Is this your mode of fishing?" and I was shown
a great seine net that lay upon the shore, and I was told, "This is
here especially for day fishing." When I stood before the young men
in the school at Kioto I referred to this. I said "It seems to me in
Japan you are doing the night fishing now; it is fishing in the night
with a torch, but, young men, there is a morning coming when the
great net is to be cast, your hands are to be upon it, and you are to
have the privilege of a great cast for God." It has come this year,
and those young men went out preachers of righteousness, clothed with
power to reach the masses of men, and they have drawn in hundreds,
and there is hope of the thousands, and that is what we want in this
work, men who can go to those Southern fields, to those five millions
of whom we have heard, and cast the great seine net of the Gospel;
and they are coming.</p>

at night for Pastor T. E. Hillson, whose second child was baptized,
as the first had been by the same hand at the dedication in Luling,
his alternate church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> 7, Wednesday.&mdash;Up at 4 and off to Luling, arriving by daylight.
Off then, by livery rig, 45 miles to Riddleville.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> 8, Thursday.&mdash;On to Helena, 15 miles. Ride out with freedman, 3
miles, to our Colony Church. Lecture at night for Pastor Thompson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> 9, Friday.&mdash;Half a day of writing. Visited at another freedman's

<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> 10, Saturday.&mdash;Brother Thompson, with another colored man and
myself, start for Corpus, 80 miles, reaching Goliad, 35 miles, at
night. We are entertained at Pastor T. Benson's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> 11, Sunday.&mdash;In the morning, Sunday-school, preaching and
communion. At night, preaching. Conferring all day, at the intervals,
with "parties," being called upon even after retiring at night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> 12, Monday.&mdash;Up and off before daylight, without breakfast. But
Mrs. Benson has provided for us a grand lunch box that lasts us three
for the two days through to Corpus. No place on the way, to put up;
no chance to buy eatables. Our boss has planned to reach the half-way
spot on the Popolota for camping. The day wears away, and it is 10
o'clock before we come to the halting-place. For the last three hours
Brother Thompson had led the way lantern in hand, splashing through
the mud and water. We turn under a live oak, take out and feed the
jaded horses, and eat our snack, and commit ourselves to the Heavenly
Father, and at 11 o'clock turn in for the night, Brother Thompson on
the ground, <i>under</i> the hack, and Brother Eding and I <i>in</i> the hack,
doubled like a couple of jackknives into our four feet square of
space, being all of a color. By our side the ponies through the night
crunch their corn; and, by turn, we jump up to drive off the cows
from stealing their hay. But we sleep, and snore, and rest some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, Jan 13.&mdash;Up and off by daybreak. We camp for breakfast
lunch. We camp for dinner lunch. As we consume the fragments, how we
do bless Mrs. Benson. When, at her own table, we had praised her
baking and cooking, she responded: "Oh, I learned that at Talladega
College." Then I had to tell Dr. Strieby's story of the native
preacher, who thanked him for the good wife who had been trained in
one of the American Missionary Association schools, saying that he
had gotten more than he had anticipated&mdash;a good cook and housekeeper.
On, on we trudge through the heavy mud. Night has come, and we are
yet seven miles from Corpus, and the cold, "wet norther" that has
been drizzling upon us all day, as we had been fearing, has at last
broken upon us. Again Brother Thompson is on the lead, with lantern
in hand, through the slush, and he has walked more than half the way
through the day. The black-waxy is heavy for the wheels, and slippery
for the poor old freedman ponies that have no shoes. Pastor J. W.
Strong, who for four years has manfully held this extreme
southwestern outpost of Congregationalism, having learned of our
approach from a dashing country rider, comes along in the dark, one
mile out to meet us, in Oriental style. After our salaams, he gallops
back to town to make the final arrangement for our entertainment. It
is now 8.30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, too late for the preaching; and, for once, the
preacher is glad that the storm has kept the people away from the
appointment. But the next night they make it up, and the preacher
tries to make it up, too. When Mr. Thompson brought me down, six
years ago, we came straight through by fording, belly-deep to the
horses, across the reef, three miles long, that forms the nexus
between the Nueces Bay and the Corpus Christi Bay. On either side was
deep water or miring sand. Once, since that, he has had to <i>tote</i> his
passengers out on his back. The reef has been washed out in spots.
Lo! this time we go up around the head of the bay, ten miles farther.
Brother Thompson claims that he can endure such jaunts without wear
or much weariness, because he is so abstemious as not to drink tea or
coffee nor to eat meat. And everybody knows him to be a true, pure
and high-minded Christian minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> who, though he has had but
little schooling, has been so taught of God in the Word, that after
these eleven years in the same parish, that at Helena, he is yet
confided in there as an able pulpit teacher. In old times, his people
were Presbyterians. Blood will tell; and doctrine, too.</p>

<h3>WEEK OF PRAYER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Nashville, Tenn.</span>&mdash;The week of prayer was observed here this year as
usual, a meeting being held each day. Notwithstanding the bad
weather, the attendance was fair and the interest good, although not
of a revival kind. Before that time special efforts had been made in
connection with the labors of Rev. Mr. Field, the evangelist, and
twenty-five professed conversions took place. A pleasant state of
feeling in religion has existed since then. In the circumstances the
order of subjects for prayer was closely observed, except that the
subject of missions was postponed until Sunday evening, that being
the regular time for our monthly missionary meeting. The occasion was
one of unusual interest. The special subjects considered were the
Congo territory, the Congo conference, the mission to Bih&eacute; and that
to Umzila's kingdom. In the last mentioned mission we here have a
peculiar interest, as two of our former students, Mr. and Mrs.
Ousley, have been sent there as missionaries by the American Board.
Both are graduates of our college course and Mr. Ousley has since
studied theology at Oberlin. A letter from him, written at Cape Town,
Africa, was read at our meeting. Since then one has been received
from Mrs. Ousley, dated at Durban, Natal, which they had reached in
safety and good health and spirits. They were about to sail the next
day for Inhambane, their final destination. So as to locate them
better we had at the meeting, on our board, a map of that station.
Our society writes them once a month. They are very dear to us and we
hope they will do much good in Africa. Mr. Ousley dedicated himself
one Sunday in the summer of 1878 to that field of labor and has never
swerved from his purpose. The last part of the meeting was devoted to
a season of prayer for Secretary Pike in consideration of his serious
illness.</p>

<div class="right smcap">A. K. Spence.</div>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p><span class="smcap">Memphis, Tenn.</span>&mdash;Our church, as formerly, observed the week of prayer,
with, however, nothing of special note in the way of outward results.
The stormy weather from the first until the middle of the week
greatly hindered the attendance. There was, notwithstanding, for
those who came, a blessed realization of spiritual benefit.</p>

<p>There were no special meetings at the Le Moyne School, the teachers
attending the night meetings at the church.</p>

<p>We were quickened by the thought that even a few souls gathered in
each of many places, make up a great company in supplication before
God. The topics presented for each evening came to our minds with
more than ordinary freshness and force, and the weight of all
accumulated to the last. I trust that we were duly impressed with a
sense of the obligation incurred by thus confessing to the truth and
importance of those themes, and by coming with them to the Lord.
Those members of church who, unhindered by other things, come to
meeting in stormy weather are more clear in their testimony that it
pays, in direct returns of spiritual strength and joy in the
fellowship of Christ.</p>

<p>The spirit of our meetings at the close was just such as warrants a
continuance of effort, but the winter has been unusually cold and,
unlike the custom North, it would be an extraordinary excitement
which would secure a general interest and attendance now.</p>

<div class="right smcap">B. A. Imes.</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<hr class="quarter" />

<p><span class="smcap">Savannah, Ga.</span>&mdash;The week of prayer was a spiritual feast to those who
attended the meetings, held each night in the Congregational Church,
and the results still continue to appear. Topics assigned by the
Alliance followed.</p>

<p>To our church the week of prayer was largely a season of review, the
whole cycle of blessings, needs and hopes passing in prayerful
review. The meeting for thanksgiving, on Monday night, was a goodly
remembrance of special blessings during the past year, and the
exercises were chiefly supplications, experiences and rejoicings of
those who one year ago had no Christian hope. By count, more than
one-half of the persons present were, as one said, only "yearlings."
The ready use of Bible promises at this meeting measured well the
value of our special missionary's Bible work. Two mothers, each with
her family about her, testified in word and deed that the one year of
Christian life had created home forces and blessings of infinite
worth. The time of confession and consecration lasted the whole week,
and proofs of genuineness are not wanting. Said one: "The new year
shall not be so dull as the old one." Another: "The new year I give
<i>all</i> to my Master, Jesus." And kindred promises were frequent and
fervent.</p>

<p>Results of week of prayer: Church much encouraged and quickened, new
consecration to work, one convert, a number of interested souls, but
chiefly the quickened desire for growth of individuals in all that
makes Christian character; and, more than all, the growth of
missionary spirit shown in the earnest prayers for the conversion of
the world to Christ.</p>

<p>At the close of the "Missionary night" meeting, one of the oldest
members of the Church called at the pastor's study and asked for the
Missionary magazines, saying: "I am just beginning to hear God's call
to missionary work, and I want to know more of what the A. M. A. is
doing for our people, and to have my part in it." Seed <i>will</i> grow.</p>

<div class="right smcap">Dana Sherrill.</div>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p><span class="smcap">Santee Agency, Neb.</span>&mdash;We remembered the week of prayer by services in
the chapel every evening, except on Thursday and Saturday, when we
held the meetings in the afternoon for the convenience of our Indians
who live at a distance from the Mission. The spirit of prayer rested
upon all of our several school boarding halls, and we felt that the
mercy seat had come near.</p>

<p>The line of instruction in these meetings was concerning the Holy
Spirit as enlightening the mind, convicting of sin, revealing Christ
to the soul, and abiding with the believer.</p>

<p>Our young men very generally took part in prayer. And their prayers
showed a clear understanding of the truths spoken, and deep feeling
with regard to their own needs and the wonderful revelation of the
mercy of Christ. And they seemed to open their hearts to the ministry
of the Spirit.</p>

<p>The same spirit of tender prayerfulness and devotion to the Master
was manifest among the girls, a number of them coming out as
candidates for church membership and eagerly forming a class for the
study of the Catechism.</p>

<p>In the middle of these days of prayer, we were startled by the word
that came from a brother missionary's family, the Rev. J. P.
Williamson, at Yankton Agency, Dakota, that his children were all
sick with scarlet fever, that one was dead and another dying. We took
their burden on our hearts in prayer. And the merciful Father spared
the one on the borders of death.</p>

<p>By this I was called away from Santee for two days to attend the
burial of the dear missionary child that was taken. But I found no
interruption of interest when I returned. Thus, all in all, the
experiences of this week have been very precious, and we believe that
larger fruits of it are yet to appear.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM A STUDENT.</h3>


<div class="right">&mdash;&mdash;, Miss., January 18, 1885.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Professor</span>: As I only wrote you a few days ago, you will no doubt
be surprised somewhat to receive this letter so soon after. But it is
on a matter of great importance that I write you. I think I told you
in my letter previous to this that I found no Sabbath-school here,
and that I had formed a little class among my day pupils.</p>

<p>This is my second Sabbath here, and we met this morning in our little
schoolroom for the first time. How happy it made me feel to meet with
such a pleasant little band of children, all eager to talk and learn
of Jesus. But I was greatly pained to find that the teachers who
recently taught here failed to have Sabbath-school. I inquired of
those present this morning how long since they had Sabbath school
here, and was informed, "three years." I then asked what the teachers
did who previously taught free school here; the answer which came
from many was, "They visited on Sundays." I don't see how they could
content themselves at doing nothing in a place like this, when there
is so much work to do. I have not in all my experience of school
teaching found a place so pitifully neglected and needful as this.
What I want to say, Professor, is this: We have no Sabbath-school
literature of any kind.</p>

<p>Have you anything that you could send me, Professor, for my little
Sabbath-school? If so, please send it at my expense. I shall be glad
to get anything that I could interest them with; I mean to have them
come to my room Sunday afternoons, that I may read to them and talk
with those who are not Christians, and perhaps you can find something
that would be good for that purpose. We shall be glad of anything.
There is so much work here, and I shall be so glad if I can do any
good. Now, Professor, if you can find <span class="smcap">anything</span> to send us, do send it
at once. Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain your pupil and
friend,</p>

<h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h3>LOU QUONG AT HIS HOME IN CHINA.</h3>

<div class="center">BY REV. W. C. POND.</div>


<p>Our brother Lou Quong, for several years the Chinese Helper in our
West School in this city, has recently returned from a visit to his
native land. I was so greatly interested in his account of his
experience as a Christian, thrown back into the heathen associations
of his childhood, that I asked him to write it out for me, and I give
it to the readers of <span class="smcap">The Missionary</span> with only a few corrections of
his English,&mdash;respecting which, during his absence, he has lost some
ground:</p>

<p>"I came to California in 1876, and lived in the city of San
Francisco. In the day-time I worked in a family, but in the evenings
I attended the Mission school. In 1877, I became a poor Christian
among our countrymen here. The schools were cared for by all the good
Christian friends that are in this free country, and even by some
from England and other nations. They were looked after by Rev. W. C.
Pond, pastor of Bethany Church&mdash;the same church that all our Chinese
brethren go to, to take the Lord's Supper, once in two months.</p>

<p>Last September I paid a visit to my home&mdash;the home that I had left
for so long a time. But before I go I make up my mind to stand up for
Jesus, who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> kindly given His life for my soul. At first my heart
was some troubled about going back to my heathen country, but I pray,
and kept praying that Jesus would go with me. So He heard my humble
prayers. He was going before me, and made everything smooth for me. I
got home Oct. 9th, at noon. In a few moments there came all the
people of my village, both young and old, women and men, asking me
about California. I answered them the best I could. Some of them try
to get a look on my head at first, to see if my hair is all right,
for they believed Christian Chinese have their queue cut off, and
belong to California. He is no more Chinaman. For this cause they
trouble me many days.</p>

<p>I met Rev. C. R. Hager at Hong Kong, when first I got there. We fell
to talking of the Mission work among our people.</p>

<p>When I was at home, as soon as my father worshiped the ancestors or
the idols, he sent one of my little sisters to call me to join the
worship; but my mother, who has a better spirit, told my father that
I would not worship them any more, "for (as she said) he have told me
that he did thank God <i>in his heart</i>, and that he love us the same."
Thus, my mother stopped the calling for the worshiping of the
ancestors ever since. I thank God for this first.</p>

<p>During the time I was at home there were seven or eight brethren
called at my house and did shake hands with me. Some of them I knew
in California, but the rest I knew not and never saw them before; yet
they could find their fellow-brethren in Christ, and came from far
to do so. Some of them are Bible-sellers; some are preachers. They
show their brotherly love and Christian faith by bringing candy and
oranges for my sisters. And my father was also glad to see them, each
time they call. Some of them did take dinner with us in our family.
Rev. Mr. Jones also call, and he preached to the people in my
village. He can use the chop-sticks, and did eat our food. In the
evening, with the moon shining, and in the day-time he asked me to
take him to the market-place, to tell the people the same thing in
Chinese as we preached here in California. He was astonished that the
people treated him so well, and did not say a bad word to him about
it.</p>

<p>Now comes the hardest thing for a Chinese Christian to bear; that is,
the marriage day. I was married on March 28, 1884. I had been engaged
by my parents when I was fourteen years old to a girl who was only
nine, and lived four miles away. When she come to our house to live
with us, then she begin to ask me why I did not worship the ancestors
with her on the marriage day; and I begin with my lesson to her in
simple things, telling her why I don't worship those things any more.
When I make a prayer to God before I go to bed she laugh at me
because I pray to nothing&mdash;no God that I can <i>see</i>. But I told her
that she must bow her head too when I pray, and must keep still. So,
after this, she pay more attention to what I tell her about this
great God that I have found in California.</p>

<p>Once she ask me why I don't take Mr. Ying's example, and do just like
he do to please all men. For Mr. Ying was living in the same house
with us, and had come back from California at the same time with me;
and though he had been in our Mission schools for two or three years,
yet he will not take Jesus as his Lord. So when he got back to China,
he do things just as free as any heathen. So I ask her: "Well,
suppose a man who served his ancestors, and all the dead and all the
idols with all his heart; yet he would not take care of himself and
go about smoking opium, gambling, throwing away his money in
foolishness, and leaving his whole family uncared for. Now, how do
you like that?" Then she said, without delay, "I will not like such a
man. I rather take a man that is called a Christian, and have him do
good, than to have him serve ancestors and gods and do bad things."
Though she was a heathen, yet I think she see a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> light now. I
left home to come here again, Oct. 29, but I still pray God to keep
her on the right way; and may she become a Christian woman by the
Lord's power alone! Thus the Lord blessed me. May He bless all the
workers in His vineyard."</p>

<p>I have exceedingly interesting accounts from the new fields: Alturas,
Modoc Co.; Tulare, Tulare Co., and San Diego. In Sacramento where
Rev. Mr. Jones is engaged in special services, we hear of crowds
gathering about him in the street when he speaks there, and following
him into the mission house till it is completely packed. We hear also
that some hearts seem to have been touched; and that the hope is
cherished that some who were far off have been brought nigh. Space
fails me to go into details; but I bespeak the earnest prayers of all
who love this cause and love our Lord, that this evangelistic work
may yield us the glad harvests for which we have been wrestling with
God.</p>

<p>We are glad to notice that the ladies of Connecticut have recently
organized a State Missionary Society to co-operate with the leading
benevolent societies for work in our own country. Nothing in these
days can be accomplished without organization. What is everybody's
business is nobody's business, and causes whose support is left to
those who merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> happen to have an interest in them are very likely
to be neglected. We wish that in every State of the Union, ladies'
domestic missionary societies might be organized. The great work
which our Association is called upon to perform among women needs to
be specially brought to the attention of the Christian ladies in our
churches. This information can only be effectually disseminated
through organized and systematic effort. We are prepared to furnish
interesting missionary material to all who will ask for it. We invite
correspondence with missionary societies, promising to give careful
attention to any inquiries they may make. With gratitude do we record
the fact that the interest in the woman's department of the American
Missionary Association's work is steadily enlarging.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM A LADY MISSIONARY.</h3>


<div class="right smcap">&mdash;&mdash;, Ga., January, 1885.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friends</span>: As I take my pen to write my mind goes back to the
general letter that I wrote. Can I tell you of any improvement among
those with whom we have to do, since that time? Watching the progress
of our school from day to day the upward tendency seems slow, but
looking back a year a marked improvement can be seen. While they
learn readily they remember well, and the homes of those who come in
contact with our church and school are different. Last Saturday was
the coldest day of the winter, but Miss Robertson and I, according to
a previous appointment went to the Dunwoody settlement to hold a
woman's meeting. I think I wrote you about a similar meeting one year
ago; this is the third one that I have held, and the meetings have
gained in interest. In that settlement, before they commence
planting, the people have a fast day; they neither eat, wash their
faces nor perform any ordinary duties from one sunset to the next.
They pray in their homes and unitedly for God's blessing upon the
labor of their hands. It reminds me of the way fast days used to be
kept in the early history of New England. I am inclined to think they
caught the idea from the people who came from New England here. I do
not know that such a custom is observed except in this settlement. I
asked the women if a blessing followed their prayers? They answered
decidedly, "Yes," and said that while the people all about them had
suffered for the necessities of life, in that settlement they had
never since freedom bought corn, rice or potatoes, but had raised
sufficient for their needs. In their simplicity they take God at His
word, "Ask and ye shall receive."</p>

<p>Last Sabbath another couple entered upon the "<i>matrimonial sea</i>,"
this time young people. The gorgeous attire of the wedding party can
be better imagined than described. We see few tokens of love and
affection among this people. In the Sunday-school lesson of last
Sabbath the questions and remarks of our pupils led us to think that
it was almost a missing link in their lives; it seemed impossible for
them to understand why the people should fall on Paul's neck and kiss
him; it is a rare sight to see a kiss exchanged among them.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after school, the parson went with me over the swamps to
the homes of some of our scholars. We passed through several ditches,
where the water was up to the hubs of the buggy wheels; there was a
log for a foot-path over these places. It was very muddy all along
the way, and yet these children are seldom absent from school.
To-day, the clouds are heavy and dark, and the rain has come down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> in
torrents, yet many have come into school from these long distances,
to our surprise, one boy having the promise of being promoted into
the second reader came at least six miles, bringing a chicken and six
eggs to pay for his book; when he arrived he was wet to his skin.
Two-thirds of our school were present to-day. I realize as never
before the effort these children are making for themselves. Oh! I
remember how freely money was given and the young men from our homes
that freedom might be obtained for this people; then the women must
wait and pray at home, but now the way is open for women to teach the
young of this vast race that the future may not disclose a nation
within a nation, hostile to the good and true of a Christian people.
Shall there not be volunteers among our New England girls, who shall
say: "Here am I. Send me" to the work?</p>

<h3>CHILDREN'S PAGE.</h3>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h3>VIC'S LILIES.</h3>


<p>School was dismissed, and the boys and girls came rushing out with
merry shouts and laughter. The voices had a musical ring and the
intonation peculiar to uncultivated colored lads and lassies. They
were a comely, thrifty-looking set, and the instinctive hopefulness
of their race looked from the bright eyes and shone in the cheery
faces. Life had gone hard with some, but had failed to quench their
faith in the good time yet to come.</p>

<p>As they neared the corner of the street and came in sight of a large,
handsome white house, a girl's voice called, "Hush! hush!"</p>

<p>"Lor', now, Vic!" her brother Phil remonstrated, "what nonsense!" But
in spite of the remonstrance every voice took a lower tone, and the
house was passed almost in silence. The blinds of the house were
closed, and from the door-knob hung the black-and-white token of
mourning. Vic was saying, "Yes, sick jest two days; taken Sunday and
died this morning. When I tol' teacher, she said, 'Death loves a
shining mark.'"</p>

<p>"I'm awful sorry," said Nan; "he was a mighty peart little 'un, and
he al'ays looked up and smiled when we passed. But if I'd knowed he
was really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> goin', I'd sent a message to sister Fan. Don't you think
she'd like to know about the Christmas tree, Vic?"</p>

<p>"You're a green un," said Phil. "You don't s'pose that little pink
and white chap has gone to our heaven, do you? He'll see Fan a heap
sight! She's off in a little cubby-hole with all the rest of the
darkies. All the first-class 'commodations b'longs to the white
peoples, ye know."</p>

<p>"Hush, Phil," said Vic; "you shan't stuff Nan so. Everything will be
all right, honey, when we gets up dere. Shouldn't be s'prised if Fan
knew all 'bout the tree. And p'rhaps the good Lord will let her help
take care of the little fellow till his po' mother comes. Ole Dinah
says she's awfully cut up&mdash;his mother, you know. You see they're
strangers here, came for the mammy's health; and Frankie, he was the
only chile. 'Pears like I want to comfort the po' mammy. My lily has
three blossoms. I mean to take them all to her."</p>

<p>"'Pears like you'd better min' your own business. She may be a dog-on
white lady, if she do come from the Norf. Like as not she'd turn up
her nose at your lilies. I'll 'low the little un was a brick, but
you'd better let his mother 'lone." This was Phil's advice.</p>

<p>But although Victoria Porter had a black skin, she had a tender,
loving heart, and she had pored over the Christ-life until she had
unconsciously imbibed its spirit. She was always yearning to comfort
some one. Later in the day she stood at the door of the white
mansion, holding her precious lilies. "They're for his mother," she
said to Dinah. "Tell her we chil'ens loved Frankie, and we're all
mighty sorry."</p>

<p>It was a simple message and a simple offering, and the giver was a
poor little black girl; but behind the gift was sincerity and love,
and the heart of the poor, sorrowing mother was touched and
comforted.</p>

<p>And Vic's lilies had a mission of which she knew not. They preached a
lovely sermon on the high privilege and duty of comforting others. We
may be poor, and very humble may be our station in life; but if we
try, we may make life brighter and sweeter to someone. What a glad
surprise it will be to Vic when the Saviour honors her many kind acts
by the words&mdash;"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto Me."</p>

dryness of the throat, acute bronchitis, coughing, soreness of the
lungs, rising bloody mucus, and even night sweats, incapacitating me
from my professional duties, and bringing me to the verge of the
grave&mdash;all were caused by, and the result of nasal catarrh. After
spending hundreds of dollars and obtaining no relief, I compounded my
Catarrh Specific and Cold Air Inhaling Balm, and wrought upon myself
a wonderful cure. Now I can speak for hours with no difficulty, and
can breathe freely in any atmosphere.<br />

I was thought to have had Consumption, and had suffered
